      <h1>Dating Safety Tips</h1>

      <p>
        Meeting new people is exciting, but you should always be cautious when
        interacting with someone you don't know. Use your best judgment and put
        your safety first, whether you are exchanging initial messages or
        meeting in person. While you can't control the actions of others, there
        are things you can do to help you stay safe during your Tinder
        experience.
      </p>

      <h2>Online Safety</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Never Send Money or Share Financial Information</strong>
          <p>
            Never send money, especially over wire transfer, even if the person
            claims to be in an emergency. Wiring money is like sending cash —
            it's nearly impossible to reverse the transaction or trace where the
            money went. Never share information that could be used to access
            your financial accounts. If another user asks you for money, report
            it to us immediately.
          </p>
          <p>
            For tips on avoiding romance scams, check out some advice from the
            U.S. Federal Trade Commission
            <a href="#" target="_blank"> on the FTC website</a>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Protect Your Personal Information</strong>
          <p>
            Never share personal information, such as your social security
            number, home or work address, or details about your daily routine
            (e.g., that you go to a certain gym every Monday) with people you
            don't know. If you are a parent, limit the information that you
            share on your profile and in early communications. Avoid sharing
            details such as your children's names, where they go to school, or
            their ages or genders.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Stay on the Platform</strong>
          <p>
            Keep conversations on the Tinder platform while you're getting to
            know someone. Because exchanges on Tinder are subject to our
            <a href="#" target="_blank">Safe Message Filters</a>, users with bad
            intentions often try to move the conversation to text, messaging
            apps, email, or phone right away.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Be Wary of Long Distance and Overseas Relationships</strong>
          <p>
            Watch out for scammers who claim to be from your country but stuck
            somewhere else, especially if they ask for financial help to return
            home. Be wary of anyone who will not meet in person or talk on a
            phone/video call—they may not be who they say they are. If someone
            is avoiding your questions or pushing for a serious relationship
            without meeting or getting to know you first — that's a red flag.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Report All Suspicious and Offensive Behavior</strong>
          <p>
            You know when someone's crossed the line and when they do, we want
            to know about it. Block and report anyone that violates our terms.
            Here are some examples of violations:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Asking you for money or donations</li>
            <li>Underage users</li>
            <li>Sending harassing or offensive messages</li>
            <li>Asking for personal information</li>
            <li>Trying to sell you products or services</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You can <a href=""> report any concerns</a> about suspicious
            behavior from any profile page or messaging window. For more
            information, check out our
            <br />
            <a href="">Community Guidelines.</a>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Protect Your Account</strong>
            </li>
            <p>
              Be sure to pick a strong password, and always be careful when
              logging into your account from a public or shared computer. Tinder
              will never send you an email asking for your username and password
              information — if you receive an email asking for account
              information, report it immediately.
            </p>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <h2>Meeting in Person</h2>
        <li>
          <strong>Don’t Be In A Rush</strong>

          <p>
            Take your time and get to know someone before agreeing to meet in
            person. Exchange a few messages and maybe do a phone or video call
            before meeting up.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meeting someone for the first time can be nerve-racking, so choose a
            public and familiar location. Don't meet at someone's home,
            apartment, or other private location for your first date.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tell a friend or family member about your plans, including who
            you're meeting, where you're going, and when you expect to be back.
            Charge your phone and have a way to get home if needed.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Meet in Public and Stay in Public</strong>
          <p>
            Meet for the first few times in a populated, public place — never at
            your home, your date’s home, or any other private location. If your
            date pressures you to go to a private location, end the date.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Tell Friends and Family About Your Plans</strong>
          <p>
            Tell a friend or family member of your plans, including when and
            where you’re going. Have your cell phone charged and with you at all
            times.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Be in Control of Your Transportation</strong>
          <p>
            We want you to be in control of how you get to and from your date so
            that you can leave whenever you want. If you’re driving yourself,
            it’s a good idea to have a backup plan such as a ride-share app or a
            friend to pick you up.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Know Your Limits</strong>
          <p>
            Be aware of the effects of drugs or alcohol on you specifically —
            they can impair your judgment and your alertness. If your date tries
            to pressure you to use drugs or drink more than you’re comfortable
            with, hold your ground and end the date.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Don’t Leave Drinks or Personal Items Unattended</strong>
          <p>
            Know where your drink comes from and know where it is at all times —
            only accept drinks poured or served directly from the bartender or
            server. Many substances that are slipped into drinks to facilitate
            sexual assault are odorless, colorless, and tasteless. Also, keep
            your phone, purse, wallet, and anything containing personal
            information on you at all times.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>If You Feel Uncomfortable, Leave</strong>
          <p>
            It’s okay to end the date early if you’re feeling uncomfortable. In
            fact, it’s encouraged. And if your instincts are telling you
            something is off or you feel unsafe, ask the bartender or server for
            help.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>LGBTQ+ Travel</strong>
          <p>
            Be careful while traveling We recognize and believe in the
            importance of being inclusive of all gender identities and sexual
            orientations, but the reality is this: nowhere in the world is
            without potential risk, and some countries have specific laws that
            target LGBTQ+ people. Check out the laws around you when you travel
            to a new place and research what types of legal protection, if any,
            are available to you based on sexual orientation. In the event that
            you’re in unsafe territory, we suggest toggling off “Show me on
            Tinder” which you can find under the settings page. If you have
            added a sexual orientation to your profile and choose to be shown on
            Tinder, we will hide your sexual orientation from your profile until
            you leave that area. It’s important to exercise extra caution if you
            choose to connect with new people in these countries - as some law
            enforcement have been known to use dating apps as tools for
            potential entrapment. Some countries have also recently introduced
            laws that criminalize communications between individuals on same-sex
            dating applications or websites and even aggravate penalties if that
            communication leads to sexual encounters. Visit
            <a href="">ILGA World</a> to see the latest sexual orientation laws
            by country, and consider donating to support their research.
